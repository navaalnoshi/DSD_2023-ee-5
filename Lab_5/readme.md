***Lab 5: Combinational Circuit Design - Seven-Segment Display Using K-Maps***

***Prerequisites***
Simulation Software: Xilinx Vivado, Questa Sim.
Hardware Knowledge: Understanding of Nexys A7 board, seven-segment displays, and their pin configurations.
Design Tools: Circuit diagrams using DrawIO.
Programming: Fundamentals of SystemVerilog.

***Contents***
-Implementation of a seven-segment display driver circuit:
-Derivation of truth table and K-maps for minimized logic.
-Circuit diagrams (manually derived and from Vivado schematic).
-Logic implementation for displaying characters on the seven-segment display.
-Testbench for verifying the circuit's correctness.
-Simulation outputs using Questa Sim.
-FPGA Implementation

***Objectives***
-Design a modular circuit to display hexadecimal characters (0-F) on one of eight seven-segment displays, based on 4-bit input.
-Control which seven-segment display is active using a 3-bit selector input.
-Minimize the logic using K-maps and implement it using SystemVerilog.
-Simulate, synthesize, and test the circuit on the Nexys A7 board.

***Learning Outcomes***
Design optimized combinational circuits using K-maps.
Understand FPGA synthesis and analyze resource utilization (LUTs, I/Os, etc.).
Verify digital designs through simulation and FPGA implementation.
